### 📋 Summary of the project.

This is my first React project. It is a CRUD application based on an api that I built. Users can view, sort and filter, vote and comment on articles. In this version, a dummy user is statically logged-in to demonstrate posting and deleting comments.

The UI is designed to support the user's expectations. When components are rendering, visual feedback is given to the user. The states of buttons indicate whether they can be or are being clicked. Components are optimistically rendered to support the flow of data on the page. If an optimistically rendered request fails, the component returns to its original state and the user is informed.

The UI changes according to the user's screen size to utilise available space.
